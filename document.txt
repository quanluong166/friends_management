-  Tech stack select

1 . Echo framework
- Since the input and output is JSON and the data is quite simple so I choose REST API for development
- Fast, highly performance, friendly for REST
- Good support for middleware if we need authentication in future development
- Good JSON support response
- Support group router for clearer API path

2. PostgresSQL
- For future development, I think we need some constraint between tables so SQL will be the best database choice
- I also think that maybe we need a database that is excellent support for string query for future development so I choose PostgreSQL.
- PostgreSQL also really good performance, support many different data types

3. Project structure -  Clean architecture
- Greate for testing and scalable purpose
- In case we need change to db or api stack it will not affect to much to business core.
